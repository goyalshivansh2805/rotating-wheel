 # Creative Rotating Color Wheel

This project is a visually stunning, interactive rotating color wheel built with pure HTML and CSS. It was created as a creative coding challenge and showcases advanced CSS effects, color cycling, and interactive animations.

## Features
- **6-Color Wheel:** Each segment is a vibrant color, smoothly animated using a conic-gradient.
- **Color Cycling:** The wheel's colors cycle endlessly for a dynamic, eye-catching effect.
- **Animated Glow & Glass Center:** The wheel features a glowing border and a glassy, animated center.
- **Sparkle Ring:** Sparkles orbit the wheel and animate only when hovered.
- **Smooth Rotation:** The wheel rotates infinitely on hover and returns smoothly to its original position when unhovered.
- **Responsive & Modern Design:** Looks great on all screen sizes.
